## Time Series Forecasting project

## Project Overview

This model demonstrates time series forecasting using various models, including LSTM, AR and ARIMA. The models are implemented to predict future values using the past data.
The project covers the following:

 1. LSTM Model: Uses Long Short-Term Memory networks for capturing long-term dependencies in data.
 2. AR Model: Applies the Autoregressive method to use past values for future predictions.
 3. ARIMA Model: Utilizes Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average to account for trends and seasonality in the data.

Libraries used or dependencies:
1. Python 3.x
2. Pandas
3. NumPy
4. Matplotlib
5. Statsmodels
6. TensorFlow (for LSTM)

The corresponding datasets that have been used are also present in the repository. In order to to implement this project/models on a different datsaset, same code snippets can be used. Just the path of the file has to be changed.
